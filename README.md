## Local Repository location
`/home/khanna7/Projects/UConnect/UConnect_FB/w1_w2_com_respondents_from_igraph/prep-awareness-use-and-fb-networks`

## File ordering  
   * List persistently unaware (PU) and became aware (BA) individuals amongst the 266 common respondents: list-pu-and-ba-on-266-com-fb-respondents.R  
   * Compute descriptives of these 266 participants, and compute summary statistics on their overall FB networks: descriptives-on-266-com-fb-respondents.R
   * Constrain the FB networks by city and sex (male): total-fb-friendships-pers-unaware-and-bec-aware.R
   * Some nearest neighbor properties: pu-vs-ba-nrst-nghbrs.R
   * Compute number and % of friends (of 266 common participants) who are PrEP-aware and PrEP-using  
   * Visualize Wave 1 and Wave 2 networks with fixed coordinates at baseline and followup: visualize-pu-and-ba.R
   * (Old visualization, not relevant: visualization.R)
